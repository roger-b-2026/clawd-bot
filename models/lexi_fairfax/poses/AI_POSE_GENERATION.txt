# AI Pose Generation (ControlNet OpenPose)

Once ComfyUI is running with ControlNet, you can generate clean pose templates
from any reference image.

## Workflow:
1. Load any reference image (Pinterest, stock photo, etc.)
2. Connect to OpenPose ControlNet node
3. Extract pose skeleton (clean, no face/body, just skeleton)
4. Save as pose template for InstantID generation

## Purpose:
- Extract pose from professional photoshoots
- Create reusable pose templates
- Build your custom library over time

## When Ready:
Use ComfyUI → ControlNet → OpenPose to extract poses from your reference images.
